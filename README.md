Transformational techniques, such as Smote and Tomek, were employed to refine the dataset. An analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an RRFM (Reception, Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach as compared to a non-engineered approach. A variety of models were utilized and the split bias was addressed through diverse data partitioning strategies. The assortment of trees used in Random Forest methodologies was varied, and Balanced Random Forest was implemented to address the skewed distribution of the outcome variable. Comparative analyses encompassed models such as KNN, SVM, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Balanced Random Forest across different approaches and data splits, ensuring a comprehensive examination of performance metrics.
